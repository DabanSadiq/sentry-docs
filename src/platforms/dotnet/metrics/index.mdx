# Emit a counter

Counters are the simplest types of metrics. With counters, you can count occurrences of certain events.

To emit a counter, you can do as follows:
```csharp
// Incrementing a counter by one for each button click.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Increment("ButtonClicked",
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

# Emit a set

Sets are useful for counting unique occurrences. With sets, you can obtain the count of unique elements that you added to it, making them very useful for certain cases.

To emit a set, you can do as follows:
```csharp
// Adding a set of unique occurrences.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Set("CheckoutCount", 7,
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Custom("items"),
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

# Emit a distribution

Distributions are useful to get the most insights from your data. With distributions, you can obtain aggregations such as `p90`, `min`, `max`, and `avg` making them very powerful.

To emit a distribution, you can do as follows:
```csharp
// Adding '15' to a distribution used to track the loading time.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Distribution("LoadingTime",
    15,
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Duration.Millisecond,
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```

# Emit a gauge

Gauges are a special kind of metric. With gauges, you can obtain aggregates like `min`, `max`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count` but no percentiles. You might be wondering why I need gauges if I have distributions that can do the same and more. Well, the answer has to do with space efficiency, since gauges can be represented in a much more space-efficient way, so if you donâ€™t need percentiles, gauges are the way to go.

To emit a gauge, you can do as follows:
```csharp
// Adding '15' to a gauge used to track the loading time.
SentrySdk.Metrics.Gauge("LoadingTime",
    15,
    unit: MeasurementUnit.Duration.Millisecond,
    tags: new Dictionary<string, string> {{ "region", "us-west-1" }});
```
