<Note>

Browser Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

The browser profiling integration is built using [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/) and will likely only move out of beta once the specification progresses and gains adoption. See platform [status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5170190448852992).

Note that since the profiling API is currently only exposed in Chromium, profiles collected only include that demographic. This is obvious, but should not be forgotten when analyzing the data collected. We hope that as the API gains adoption, other browsers will implement it as well.

<PlatformContent includePath="profiling/index/why-profiling" />

In order to get started with browser profiling, you'll need to:

- Install the @sentry/browser SDK
- Configure the document response header to include `Document-Policy: js-profiling`
- Configure the SDK to use the `BrowserProfilingIntegration` and set `profilesSampleRate`

## Install

<PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Install our JavaScript browser SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is **7.60.0**.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript.electron"]}>

Install our Electron SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is **4.16.0**.

</PlatformSection>

## Add Document-Policy: js-profiling header

In order for the profiler to start, the document response header has to include a `Document-Policy` header key with the `js-profiling` value.

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle. Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK will capture all unhandled exceptions and transactions.
