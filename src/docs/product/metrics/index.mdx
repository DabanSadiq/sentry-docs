## What Are Metrics?

Metrics are numerical values that help you track the things you care about most in your application over time. You can create metrics to measure things like latency, processing time or user signups, and visualise them in Sentry in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the health of your systems.

## Metric Types

Metrics at Sentry come in different flavors, in order to help you track your data in the most efficient and cost-effective way. The types of metrics we currently support are:

- Counters → track a value that can only be incremented (e.g. button clicks)
- Distributions → track a list of values over time in on which you can perform aggregations like max, min, avg (e.g. page load times)
- Gauges → track a value that can go up and down (e.g. available disk space, memory used)
- Sets → track a set of values on which you can perform aggregations such as count_unique (e.g. number of unique users)

A metric also needs to have a unit associated to it, so that you know what you're dealing with. Examples of units are seconds, milliseconds, bytes, or even potatoes if you like.

## Augmenting Metrics with Tags

Metrics are pretty powerful, but you can enrich them further by adding dimensions to them in the form of Tags. They are key/value string pairs (e.g. cuisine:Italian) that are associated with metrics to provide contextual information, distinguish, and group metrics during analysis.

Sentry adds certain common tags by default (project, environment and release), but you can create your own tags to track attributes that help organise your data for your specific use case. Some common examples of useful tags include browser name, region, language or customer.

## Limits and Restrictions

### Cardinality

You might have heard the words cardinality explosion when talking about metrics. We will try to explain what this seemingly complex term means.

Suppose you are trying to make dinner plans and want your friends to vote on their preference. Each vote has two properties:
- Cuisine Type → type of the restaurant (e.g., Asian, Italian, German).
- Price → price range of the restaurant (e.g. $, $$, $$).

How would you count all the votes by type and price? The simple solution is to create multiple boxes that contain all the votes for the combinations of type and price (e.g., Italian-$, German-$$). If you have 3 types and 3 prices, the resulting number of boxes you need is 9, which is already quite a lot.

Now, a friend comes and says, let's add another property which is the day of the month, which has 31 values. Now all the combinations go from 3 × 3 = 9 to 3 × 3 × 31 = 279, pretty insane. This is what is known as a cardinality explosion.

To prevent such an explosion, the simple solution is to try and use tags, whose number of distinct values is low. The end goal is to have a small product of the tag values.

### Tags
Tag keys have a maximum length of 32 characters and can contain only letters (a-zA-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), periods (.), colons (:), and dashes (-).

Tag values have a maximum length of 200 characters and they cannot contain the newline (\n) character.

### Retention

Metrics are retained for 90 days in sentry.io (the same retention period as other event types, such as Errors and Transactions). The retention period is not configurable.
