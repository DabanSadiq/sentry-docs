## Why profiling?

With [profiling](/product/profiling/), Sentry tracks your software's performance by sampling your program's call stack in a variety of environments, collecting function level information about your code and enables you to fine tune the performance of your program. Sentry profiling captures function calls and their exact locations, aggregates them and shows you the most common code paths of your program, which surfaces areas of optimization opportunity that can help you increase both the performance of your code and increase user satisfaction, as well as drive down costs.
